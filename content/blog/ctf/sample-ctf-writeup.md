This is a sample CTF writeup to demonstrate how I'll structure my cybersecurity challenge solutions.

## Challenge Overview

**Challenge Name**: Sample Web App  
**Category**: Web Exploitation  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Points**: 100

## Initial Reconnaissance

The challenge presents us with a simple web application. Let's start by understanding what we're working with:

```bash
# Basic port scan
nmap -sC -sV target.com
```

## Vulnerability Discovery

After exploring the application, I identified a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the login form.

## Exploitation

The vulnerability was in the username field:

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
```

This bypassed the authentication and gave us access to the admin panel.

## Flag Capture

Once inside the admin panel, the flag was located in the source code:

```
flag{this_is_a_sample_flag}
```

## Lessons Learned

- Always test input validation thoroughly
- SQL injection remains a common vulnerability
- Source code inspection can reveal hidden information

## Tools Used

- Burp Suite
- SQLMap
- Browser Developer Tools
