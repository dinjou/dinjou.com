Being the Networking Representative for Utah State University's Student Organization for Cybersecurity has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my college career. It's given me the opportunity to combine my passion for cybersecurity with community building and education.

## The Mission

Our cybersecurity club exists to:
- Provide hands-on cybersecurity education beyond the classroom
- Create a supportive community for students interested in security
- Bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world practice
- Prepare students for careers in cybersecurity

## My Role as Networking Representative

### Skills Nights Facilitation

One of my primary responsibilities is organizing and teaching at our "Skills Nights" events. These sessions focus on:
- Practical cybersecurity techniques
- Hands-on labs and demonstrations
- Real-world scenario discussions
- Tool tutorials and walkthroughs

### Community Building

I've worked to strengthen our community both online and offline:
- Revamped our Discord server to better match member preferences
- Increased engagement through interactive channels
- Organized study groups and collaboration sessions
- Facilitated networking opportunities with industry professionals

## Impact and Growth

### Engagement Metrics

Since taking on this role, we've seen:
- Increased Discord activity and member participation
- Higher attendance at Skills Nights
- More collaborative projects between members
- Stronger connections with industry partners

### Educational Outcomes

Our members have benefited from:
- Practical skills that complement classroom learning
- Exposure to industry tools and techniques
- Mentorship from experienced professionals
- Career guidance and networking opportunities

## Lessons in Leadership

### Understanding Your Audience

One of the most important lessons I've learned is the importance of understanding what your community actually wants and needs. When I redesigned our Discord server, I made sure to:
- Survey members about their preferences
- Observe how they naturally interacted
- Implement changes based on actual usage patterns
- Continuously iterate based on feedback

### Balancing Structure with Flexibility

Running educational events requires finding the right balance between:
- Structured learning objectives and organic discussion
- Beginner-friendly content and advanced topics
- Theory and hands-on practice
- Individual learning and group collaboration

## Technical Skills Development

Through my club involvement, I've developed skills in:
- Community management platforms (Discord, Slack)
- Educational content creation
- Event planning and facilitation
- Technical presentation and demonstration

## Looking Forward

My experience with the cybersecurity club has reinforced my passion for both cybersecurity and education. I'm excited to continue building our community and helping fellow students develop the skills they need for successful careers in security.

The combination of technical knowledge, leadership experience, and community building skills I'm developing will serve me well in my future career, whether in industry or potentially in education and training roles.

## Why Community Matters

In cybersecurity, we're stronger together. The threats we face are constantly evolving, and the best defense is a community of knowledgeable, connected professionals who share information and support each other. Building that community starts in college, and I'm proud to be part of that effort at USU.
