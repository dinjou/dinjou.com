こんにちは!

I'm Spencer, a tech enthusiast with experience in cybersecurity, network operations, and data analytics.

## Welcome to my digital space!

This site showcases my journey in technology, from cybersecurity and network operations to data analytics and software development. Explore my projects, learn about my experience, and discover how I'm using technology to solve real-world problems.

In my spare time, I enjoy photography and video editing, blending technology with art. Japanese culture, language, and music excite me, but not as much as the fact that you're on my page. I'm looking forward to getting to know you!
