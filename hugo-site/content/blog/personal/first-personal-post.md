Technology has always fascinated me, but recently I've been thinking about the deeper purpose behind what we build and how we use it.

## Beyond the Code

When I first started learning about cybersecurity and network operations, I was drawn to the technical challenges. But as I've grown in my career, I've realized that the most rewarding aspects aren't just about solving complex problemsâ€”they're about protecting people and organizations.

## The Human Element

In my role monitoring networks across 26 states, I'm not just managing infrastructure. I'm helping ensure that:

- Businesses can continue serving their customers
- Healthcare systems remain operational
- Educational institutions can continue teaching
- Families stay connected

## Finding Meaning

This realization has shifted my perspective on what success means in technology. It's not just about technical achievement, but about how our work serves others and contributes to something larger than ourselves.

## Questions I'm Exploring

- How can we use technology to create positive change?
- What does it mean to be a responsible technologist?
- How do we balance innovation with ethical considerations?

I'll be sharing more thoughts on these topics as I continue my journey of discovery and growth.
