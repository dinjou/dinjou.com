こんにちは!

I'm Spencer, a tech enthusiast with experience in cybersecurity, network operations, and data analytics.

## Just a fair warning, this site isn't really complete yet.

I've got it live because I need it to be for one of my classes, but I do intend to come back and make it a little cooler, a little cleaner, and a whole lot more functional.

In my spare time, I enjoy photography and video editing, blending technology with art. Japanese culture, language, and music excite me, but not as much as the fact that you're on my page. I'm looking forward to getting to know you!
