        <h2 id="-a-website-for-a-non-web-developer">üåê A Website for a Non-Web Developer</h2>
<p>One extraordinarily valid question to ask me here is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you use like, Squarespace or something?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, the answer is simple: I enjoy building my own things. I could use a pre-baked solution, but I enjoy knowing that I can get my hands under the hood, rip out the guts and start anew if I really want to.</p>
<p>See, I started off building dinky little games in Game Maker 7 when I was a kid, and though I never really went deep on any particular discipline of software development, I have worked in many languages over the years. In college, I did some web-dev 101, and while I definitely didn&rsquo;t gravitate toward it, I can appreciate that it&rsquo;s a useful skill. I figured, &ldquo;Hey, I know how to run my own webserver, I know enough web-dev to be dangerous, and with AI to augment that I betcha I can make something nice, something that I like without paying for a service I don&rsquo;t need.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="-about-my-website-design-and-process">üìù About my Website Design and Process</h2>
<h3 id="-meeting-my-needs">‚òëÔ∏è Meeting My Needs</h3>
<p>I started building this website a handful of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I need a one-stop-shop portfolio.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The first thing I want people to see when they visit this page is exactly what they want: quick access to what they need. Visitors should find what they want to know quickly so they can determine whether I&rsquo;m what they&rsquo;re looking for. They shouldn&rsquo;t have to go digging for that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I want a blog to showcase my skills, abilities, talents, and projects.</strong>
<ul>
<li>I want to be able to <strong>show</strong>, not tell. I love writing, and I love showing off what I&rsquo;ve worked on. It just makes sense for me to have something like this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I enjoy the creative, iterative process of development.</strong>
<ul>
<li>I started off with my own DIY site, you can see it in early commits.</li>
<li>It was cute, and I loved learning more about CSS, but it wasn&rsquo;t scaleable or sustainable long-term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-why-build-with-ai">ü§ñ Why Build with AI?</h3>
<p>Oh trust me: I have my concerns. Whether it&rsquo;s security, code-spaghettification, or just general moral objection, I have my reservations. Even so, it boils down to this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I want to learn how to use AI as a tool effectively.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is a learning-experience. AI is improving at an unprecedented rate, love it or hate it, and I&rsquo;d rather get ahead of the curve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I don&rsquo;t want to pay for a website builder.</strong>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a billion frameworks and services out there. WYSIWYG is great, but I enjoy tinkering too much. This is simply more enjoyable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-story-behind-dinjoucom">The Story Behind &ldquo;dinjou.com&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Storytime.</p>
<p>I ran into the age-old problem of usernames. Find one you like and it&rsquo;s probably already taken, especially if it&rsquo;s short.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve adopted five or six usernames over the years, but &ldquo;dinjou&rdquo; is probably the closest to my heart. Back in my college days, a group of friends and I were playing Minecraft together, running off of an old university surplus computer as a server. My in-game handle at the time was &ldquo;TheLegendOfDin&rdquo; (a nod to the goddess in the Legend of Zelda). My friends just called me &ldquo;Din,&rdquo; and I came to enjoy the nickname. Eventually, it became my handle on Discord, as well. By the time I became the admin of the USU Cybersecurity Club Discord, it was just something that people called me, both online and IRL.</p>
<p>At that point, I wanted to trim my username down to just &ldquo;din&rdquo; but c&rsquo;mon: That username is taken <em>everywhere.</em> I <strong>needed</strong> a way to make it mine. So, what did I do? I leaned into my limited understanding of Japanese. I compared and contrasted various readings of several kanji centered around the sound &ldquo;din&rdquo; and eventually landed on some with a rough interpretation and sound that I liked: ‰ªÅÈå† (din-jou). I chose these characters because I enjoyed combining their individual ideas. ‰ªÅ can be &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; or &ldquo;humanity,&rdquo; and Èå† can be &ldquo;lock&rdquo; or &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; - strength or stability. I want others to know that they can count on me, and that I strive to be a good person. I believe charity to be a virtue and a strength, not a burden.</p>
<p>To be strong because of a desire to do good virtue is the kind of person I want to be. It was a long, roundabout way of coming to a username, but it was fun. That&rsquo;s why I also wanted to use it as my domain: It&rsquo;s a principle-driven approach to representing who I want to be.</p>
<h2 id="what-ive-learned-so-far">What I&rsquo;ve Learned So Far</h2>
<p>Building this site has been a great opportunity for me to play with Cursor and get familiar with what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t for an AI-first development workflow. Worse comes to worst, it can be its own portfolio piece and can be torn down and rebuilt by hand if needed.</p>
<p>The migration from my original static HTML site to Hugo has been educational, and working with AI to help with the technical aspects has let me focus more on the content and design decisions rather than getting bogged down in implementation details.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>This website is very much a work in progress, but that&rsquo;s part of what makes it fun. It&rsquo;s a living representation of my growth as both a technologist and a person. Every improvement, every new blog post, every project I add - it all contributes to a more complete picture of who I am and what I can do.</p>
<p>So welcome to my little corner of the internet. I hope you find something here that resonates with you, whether it&rsquo;s a project that inspires you, a blog post that helps you learn something new, or just a glimpse into how one person approaches the intersection of technology and creativity.</p>
