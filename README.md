Because I want a "me" website. It's that simple.

>[NOTE!]
>My website is offline at the moment. It was started at a time when I couldn't invest appropriate resources into its development and security. The code here does represent it's current state before I took it down, but the goal is to spin up a nicer, newer, cooler personal blog of sorts within the month.

I intend to do the following with my website once I do get it back up and running:

- Show off some of my personal projects and skills
- Publish writeups on some of my proud moments in CTF Challenges
- Maintain two separate, but paralell blogs:
  - One of my professional life and achievements.
  - One on life, purpose, discovering potential, and other such musings.
